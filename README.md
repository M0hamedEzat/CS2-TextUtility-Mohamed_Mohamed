For this assignment, we are working on developing a simple text utility library in C++ that focuses on basic text processing tasks. A key requirement is to use C-style strings only—so instead of std::string, I’ll be using character arrays (char[]) or pointers to characters (char*).

The project will be modular, meaning we’ll separate the code into multiple files based on functionality to keep things organized and scalable. we’ll also use a build system like CMake to manage the compilation and linking process efficiently.

Finally, we’ll be managing the entire project using Git, which includes version control for tracking changes, creating commits, and possibly using branches to manage features or fixes. This assignment will help us practice working with lower-level string manipulation in C++, structuring code across files, and using real-world tools like CMake and Git.
